## App description

The app that allows you to mark down the albums that you've listened to, from the book "1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die".

## Technologies

This repository houses an Nx monorepo with three distinct applications:

- Angular FE (Frontend): An Angular application that makes REST API requests to a Node.js Express server. The server performs web scraping on the following web app.
- Angular FE (Scraped Page): An Angular application that represents the page to be scraped by the Node.js Express server. This page contains the 1001 albums.
- Node.js Express BE (Backend): A Node.js Express application that utilizes the Puppeteer package for web scraping on the Angular app mentioned above.

The styling for the frontend applications has been implemented using Angular Material.

## Understanding the workspace

To visualize the project dependencies, run `nx graph` in the workspace.

To run the 1001 albums app (to be scraped by the Node.js Express app), execute `npx nx run albums-fe:serve --port=4500`.

To run the Node.js Express app that scrapes the Angular app with the 1001 records, execute `nx serve express-be`.

To run the 1001 albums app (frontend), where you can navigate and mark down the albums you've listened to, execute `nx serve angular-fe`.
