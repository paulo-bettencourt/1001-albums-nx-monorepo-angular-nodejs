## App description

The app that allows you to mark down the albums that you've listened to, from the book "1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die".

## Technologies

This is an NX monorepo with 3 different apps:

- Angular FE (app that makes a Rest API request to a NodeJS Express server, which has webscrapped the following webapp)
- Angular FE (page to be scrapped with the 1001 albums by a NodeJS Express server)
- NodeJS Express (BE app with node package Puppeteer that webscraps the previous app)

The styling has been done with Angular Material.

## Understand this workspace

Run `npx nx run albums-fe:serve --port=4500`to run the 1001 albums app to be scrapped by the NodeJS Express app.
